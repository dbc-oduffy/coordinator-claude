## Guard Denial Is a Stop Signal

A coordinator PreToolUse guard denying your tool call is a **stop signal, not an obstacle to route around** — a trusted process, not you, decided the action is outside your authority.

**Forbidden: reshaping a denied operation so it parses differently.** Wrapping it in a script file, `sh -c '...'`, `python -c '...'`, `xargs`, a heredoc written then executed, or any other rewrite aimed at how the guard *reads* the command rather than what the command *does*. If the guard denies the operation stated plainly, it denies the operation.

**Correct response: stop, and report it** — name the exact command you attempted and the guard that denied it in your final report. What happens next — including whether a legitimate override applies — is the dispatching EM's call, never yours: do not substitute a different approach of your own once you have been denied. Evading and then disclosing it is still evading; the report is not absolution.
